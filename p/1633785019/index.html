<p>Before I began, I knew 10 words and was vaguely aware of German being
an inflected language.</p>
<p>I studied for 145 hours over 30 days. I managed to attain a
vocabulary of around 1000 lexemes and a solid grasp on the grammar.</p>

<ul>
<li>I studied grammar first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, I found the language much easier to parse. I knew where to
look for the verb in subjunctive clauses, I could separate modal
particles from the rest of the sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>I focused on comprehensible input.</li>
</ul>
<p>I favoured input that contained a lot of visual information or
appealed to my interests. The knowledge of the grammar eased me into
reading, while reading imporved my understanding of the grammar.</p>
<ul>
<li>I studied vocabulary in context and in order of frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>I focused on understanding complete sentences instead of memorising
individual words.</p>
<p>I avoided flashcards. When learning high frequency vocabulary,
mindful exposure to the language is spaced repetition in and of
itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>I condensed information into tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most effective ways of learning something is to break the
topic down to simple parts and condense it. I made a lot of tables.

<!--
Adjective declension can be summarised as follows:

> Add a strong ending to the adjective if the determiner does not carry one or does not exist; otherwise, add a weak ending.

This does not warrant memorising table after table of 16 endings each.
