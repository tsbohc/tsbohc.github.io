      <p>Before I began, I knew 10 words and was vaguely aware of German being an inflected language.</p>
      <p>I studied for 145 hours over 30 days. I managed to attain a vocabulary of around 1000 lexemes and a solid grasp on the grammar.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I studied grammar first.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When I felt somewhat comfortable with pronunciation and orthography, I moved on to grammar.</p>
      <p>Later on, I found the language much easier to parse. I knew where to look for the verb in subjunctive clauses, I could separate modal particles from the rest of the sentence.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I focused on comprehensible input that was just out of reach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I favoured input that contained a lot of visual information or appealed to my interests.</p>
      <p>The knowledge of the grammar eased me into reading, while reading imporved my understanding of the grammar.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I studied vocabulary in context and in order of frequency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I focused on understanding complete sentences instead of memorising individual words.</p>
      <p>I avoided flashcards. When learning high frequency vocabulary, mindful exposure to the language is spaced repetition in and of itself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I restructured information to make it easier to remember.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the most effective ways of learning something is to break the topic down to simple parts and condense it. I made a lot of tables.</p><!--
Adjective declension can be summarised as follows:

 Add a strong ending to the adjective if the determiner does not carry one or does not exist; otherwise, add a weak ending.

This does not warrant memorising table after table of 16 endings each.
