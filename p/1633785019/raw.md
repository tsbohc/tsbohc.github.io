Before I began, I knew 10 words and was vaguely aware of German being an inflected language.

I studied for 145 hours over 30 days. I managed to attain a vocabulary of around 1000 lexemes and a solid grasp on the grammar.

## approach

- I studied grammar first.

Later on, I found the language much easier to parse. I knew where to look for the verb in subjunctive clauses, I could separate modal particles from the rest of the sentence.

- I focused on comprehensible input.

I favoured input that contained a lot of visual information or appealed to my interests. The knowledge of the grammar eased me into reading, while reading imporved my understanding of the grammar.

- I studied vocabulary in context and in order of frequency.

I focused on understanding complete sentences instead of memorising individual words.

I avoided flashcards. When learning high frequency vocabulary, mindful exposure to the language is spaced repetition in and of itself.

- I condensed information into tables.

One of the most effective ways of learning something is to break the topic down to simple parts and condense it. I made a lot of tables.

<!--
Adjective declension can be summarised as follows:

> Add a strong ending to the adjective if the determiner does not carry one or does not exist; otherwise, add a weak ending.

This does not warrant memorising table after table of 16 endings each.
