      <p>4d6 drop the lowest is biased and lacks control and predictability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some characters will have a maxed out stat at level 1. All you need is a +2 racial and a pinch (1d10) of luck.</li>
        <li>Others will end up too well-rounded, leaving no opportunity to exaggerate their flaws via stats.</li>
        <li>Someone will roll everything below average and feel even more left out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rolling dice is exciting and simply is not worth giving up for the standard array.</p>

      <pre><code>W: [highest 3 of 4d6]

ABILITIES: 6 d (W)
loop A over {1..6} {
    output (A @ ABILITIES) named "Ability [A]"
}

      <ul>
        <li>Roll 3d10 and write down the highest. Repeat six times.</li>
        <li>Take a value from (1 2 3 4 5 6) and add it to a roll of your choice. Repeat for each stat. Each value can only be used once. Each roll can only receive one bonus value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See <a href="https://anydice.com/program/24b25">anydice</a>.</p>
      <pre><code>W: [highest 1 of 3d10]

ABILITIES: 6 d (W)
loop A over {1..6} {
    output (A @ ABILITIES + (7 - A)) named "Ability [A]"
}
</code></pre>
      <ul>
        <li>De-emphasises dice rolls while keeping them exciting.</li>
        <li>Players have more control. They can either focus on the primary ability or settle for a more balanced build.</li>
        <li>The resulting values are more befitting of a novice adventurer and allow for a better sense of progression.</li>
        <li>Both strengths and flaws are more prevalent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The total is 68.9 (59-78) compared to 73.5 (61-86).</p>
      <p>The 4 point decrease in power is negated by the fact that players can bring stats to even breakpoints via the bonus array.</p>
      <p>Variability between totals is also reduced by 4 points.</p>
