      <p>Here is an example to illustrate this:</p>

        d. <em>telo nasa</em> is made out of oranges.</p>

      <p>Clearly, <em>telo nasa</em> refers to an alcoholic beverage. But how did we arrive at this conclusion?</p>
      <p>Let us consider a few words that could replace <em>telo nasa</em> in these 4 contexts. When a word is appropriate in a context (a, b, c, or d), we will mark that context with a <em>y</em> and with a <em>.</em> when it is not.</p>

        <li><em>telo nasa</em> is inherently appropriate in all contexts.</li>
        <li><em>juice</em> is stored in bottles and is made out of oranges, but everyone can drink juice and it does not make people drunk.</li>
        <li><em>pancake</em> fits none of the contexts.</li>
        <li>
          <em>wine</em> fits all of the contexts but the one that specifies the main ingredient<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because <em>wine</em> is the best fit for these contexts, we can assume that <em>telo nasa</em> shares some of its properties.</p>
      <p>Now, what if it was possible to make a computer do the same thing? That is, to infer meaning from context just like we have.</p>
      <h2 id="wordembedding">word embedding</h2>
      <p>Let us write a program that will make a computer look through the words in a corpus, one by one. It will also count how many times each of the other words appears in the context of the current word.</p>
      <p>For now, let us look at the contexts from the previous example. We will only consider <em>telo nasa</em> and its surrounding content words that are less general.</p>

      <p>What can be said about <em>telo nasa</em> based on the data provided by the program?</p>
      <p>That it is related to people and drinking, but also the legal age, bottles, and citruses or the colour orange. It is however, not related to quaternions, the printing press, or non-euclidean geometry.</p>

      <p>Now <em>telo nasa</em> can be represented as a set of numbers: [0.16, 0.16, 0.33, 0.33, 0.16, 0.16]. This is its <em>word vector</em>, a numerical description of a word relative to every other word in a corpus. Every single word in a corpus can have one such vector.</p>
      <p>Because we are operating on vectors, the principles of linear algebra can be applied to them. We will use <em>cosine similarity</em><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> to determine the degree of similarity between two vectors, that is, to quantify their semantic similarity.</p>
      <p>Right now, our corpus is highly specialised, but what if we had more contexts featuring more words?</p>
      <p>What if instead of 4 contexts, we had <em>a quarter of a million</em>?</p>

      <p>J. R. R. Tolkien wrote books so that his languages had somewhere to live and thrive. Since then, many people have created their own languages. One of them is jan Sonja.</p>
      <h2 id="tokipona">toki pona</h2>
      <p>In 2001, jan Sonja created <em>toki pona</em>, a philosophical constructed language centered around minimalism. The vocabulary of <em>toki pona</em> contains only 120-180 words.</p>
      <p><em>toki pona</em> is recognised by the <a href="https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data/t?title=tok&amp;field_iso639_cd_st_mmbrshp_639_1_tid=All&amp;name_3=&amp;field_iso639_element_scope_tid=All&amp;field_iso639_language_type_tid=All&amp;items_per_page=200">ISO 639-3</a> registry under <em>tok</em>. It is the second most spoken<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> constructed language in the world.</p>
      <p>The words <em>telo nasa</em> mean <em>weird liquid</em>, which is a common way of referring to alcohol.</p>

      <p><em>toki pona</em> is an uninflected language. Basic sentences have the following structure:</p>

      <p>I have compiled a corpus containing <em>214000</em> sentences in <em>toki pona</em>. Each sentence is preceded by the date of writing. It spans over 10 years, half of the language's existence.</p>
      <p>With this corpus, I have constructed a VSM (Vector Space Model) of <em>toki pona</em>. That is, I have calculated the <em>word vector</em> of every word in the vocabulary of <em>toki pona</em>. Meaning that I have the data that shows the semantic relationships between them.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind that there are only two words in <em>toki pona</em> that can denote celestial bodies. Also, <em>cosine similarity</em> ranges from <em>-1</em> to <em>1</em>, meaning that <em>0.659</em> is almost an exact match (83%).</p>

      <p>The following is just a couple of examples.</p>
      <p>Despite <em>pimeja</em> (black) being a colour, it is more semantically connected to the word <em>tenpo</em> (time). This is because the most common usage of <em>pimeja</em> is to specify a time of day.</p>
      <p>In contrast, <em>kasi</em> (plant) is closely related to the rest of the colours. This is because <em>toki pona</em> has one word for blue and green: <em>laso</em>. Despite the existence of natural languages that do this, the majority of <em>toki pona</em> speakers feel the need to refer to these colours unambiguously.</p>
      <h2 id="argumentation">argumentation</h2>
      <p>This research aims to analyse and classify the vocabulary of <em>toki pona</em> based on the actual usage patterns of the language via the methodology discussed previously.</p>
      <p>Observations like the ones above cannot be made based on the existing dictionaries of the language, nor any other resource. They cannot be made without studying how the language is spoken. The VSM provides us with this data.</p>
      <p>There was no VSM of <em>toki pona</em> prior to this research. There is no larger corpus of <em>toki pona</em>. There is no other dated corpus at all.</p>
      <p>With the access to the time of writing of each sentence, changes in the vocabulary can be tracked from 2010 up to the present.</p>

      <p><strong>Title.</strong> TOKI PONA: DISTRIBUTIONAL APPROACH TO SEMANTIC ANALYSIS OF A CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE.</p>
      <p><strong>Subject.</strong> Semantic analysis and classification of vocabulary.</p>
      <p><strong>Object.</strong> <em>toki pona</em>, a constructed language.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem.</strong> The publicly available dictionaries do not fully reflect how the language is spoken today.</p>
      <p><strong>Goal.</strong> Perform the semantic analysis and classification of the vocabulary of the language.</p>
      <p><strong>Methodology.</strong> Distributional semantics and natural language processing, namely language modelling (word embedding).</p>
      <p><strong>Objectives.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define distributional semantics and distributional models.</li>
        <li>Discuss modern implementations of distributional models.</li>
        <li>Define and classify constructed languages.</li>
        <li>Describe <em>toki pona</em>, its philosophy, history, and unique features.</li>
        <li>Obtain the necessary corpora.</li>
        <li>Normalise the input data.</li>
        <li>Construct a vector space model of the language.</li>
        <li>Make observations on the model.</li>
        <li>Classify the words of the vocabulary based on the observed semantic relationships between them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Relevance.</strong></p>
      <p>Constructed language are gaining popularity. With the rise of the internet, these languages now have a space where they can be created, discussed, learnt, taught, and spoken. Despite this, the only constructed language that has seen much representation in scientific writing is Esperanto.</p>
      <p>The existing dictionaries of Toki Pona could benefit from the findings of this research. This data can also be used as an aid in teaching the language to new speakers.</p>
      <p>The vector space model of Toki Pona developed in the course of this research can find further use in machine translation, topic modelling, text prediction, sentiment analysis, and many other areas.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal reasons.</strong></p>
      <p>I like <em>toki pona</em>. I want more people to learn about it. I want to see it grow.</p>
